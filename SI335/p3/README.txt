    I TALKED ABOUT THE PROJECT WITH ASHLEY, PATRICK, AND CODY BEFORE ANY OF US WROTE ANY CODE.
    WE DISCUSSED BIG PICTURE ASPECTS SUCH US USING A GRAPH OF ONLY THE TARGETS AND ASSETS
    TO SIMPLIFY ROUTING

3) HOW IT WORKS

    I FIRST START BY READING ALL THE DATA INTO A PLAN CLASS. I THEN CREATE A GRAPH FROM THE 2D
    ARRAY GIVEN. I TURN EVERY GRID INTO A NODE AND THEN BUILD EDGES FROM ASSETS AND TARGETS TO
    EACHOTHER. I THEN ITERATIVELY PICK THE CLOSEST NODE TO EACH ASSET AND SEND IT THERE, THEN
    WITH EACH ASSETS NEW LOCATION, I PICK THE NEXT CLOSEST TARGET TO WHERE IT IS CURRENTLY. MY
    SOLUTION IS TIME INDEPENDENT, AND OFTEN LEADS ASSSETS TO BE CLOSE TO EACHOTHER IN PROXIMITY
    BUT BE FAR AWAY FROM EACHOTHER IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE GOING.
